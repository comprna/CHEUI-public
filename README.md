CHEUI (Methylation (CH<sub>3</sub>) Estimation Using Ionic current) is a software for the characterization of m6A and m5C RNA modifications from nanopore direct-RNA sequencing data. CHEUI can be used to detect m6A and m5C modifications at single read resolution and to identified modified sites and their stoichiometry in a transcriptome annotation in individual conditions, i.e. without the need of using a knock-out/knock-down or control sample (e.g. in-vitro trnscribed RNA). CHEUI also detects differential m6A or m5C between any two conditions.
